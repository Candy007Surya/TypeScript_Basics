tsc :-TypeScript Compiler

Steps to create an project 
1.tsc -- init :--->To initialize a TypeScript project, it simply creates an config file tsconfig.json
2.npm init -y :---->command will initialize a project and create the package. json file.
3.Create an index.html file and in that just put ! and enter a simple body is creates in it[ here create script which language]
4.mkdir src
5.mkdir dist :---> this src source file and dist in distrubance which we use in production 


Step2 :-
1.create a new file in src with index.ts where we write our code in it 
Note :- in dist where automaticallhy index.js is created or we can creat wemanually too 
2.now the index.html file go there and linkup the index.js which we created in dist like "./dist/index.js"
Note1:- In genreal what ever we created in .ts file has to convert into .js file it has to happen automatically to make it automatically
open the tsconfig.json file and  and uncommenct the "outdir" and make it as  like this :-- "outDir": "./dist",
3. tsc -w :--> it means it will run in watch mode [ this helps to create automatic js file in dist floder]

Step3 :-
1.we can open index.html either by double or by server calling here we are treating it as server and below packages need for it 
npm i lite-server :---> is to add the "lite-server" package as a development dependency to your Node.js project. The "lite-server" is a lightweight development server that is useful for testing and previewing web applications during development
2.now open the index.html with right click open with love serve [ if no option then add from extension]
3.if we dnot want to install extension then open package.json file under script put  "start":"lite-server", and from the terminal give
as npm start:-- command to run it
